                    starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars
                    on

                    by
                    Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him
                    about
                    breeding
                    pest-resistent plants.

                    Instead,
                    the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria,

                    Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team

                    wheat.

                    genetically
                    modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable
                    land.
                    Says
                    that
                    GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying
                    plants
                    and
                    animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the
                    best
                    breeds."
